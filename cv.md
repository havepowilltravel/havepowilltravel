# The Current Pack o' Lies

Or, as William Goldman titled one of his books: "Which Lie Did I Tell?"

At Pentek we had a once-a-month Saturday proposal writing sprint, based on the last few weeks worth
of Commerce Business Daily RFPs.  Part of the process was to massage the CVs being submitted with the 
proposals, making them as strong as possible.  "A pack of lies," Schwartztrauber always called them, only
partially in jest.

And the name stuck.
