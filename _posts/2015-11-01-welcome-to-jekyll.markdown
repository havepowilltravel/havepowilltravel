# The Virtues of Jekyll

Much has been written elsewhere about the virtues of Jekyll over ... um ... say, WordPress.  For a fairly straight-forward blog, the difference can be summed up as, "Swatting a fly with a flyswatter instead of a frying pan."

Going back to the essential purpose of this blog, which is to keep a notebook, why is a full-blown content management system needed?  Does it add anything except overhead?  And bugs, of course. (insert animated gif here)
