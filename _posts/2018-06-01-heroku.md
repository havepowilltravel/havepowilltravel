# A Few Particulars, or Peculiars

1.  pg:push will ask for a password to the SOURCE (local) database.  This account defaults to the login name on the localhost.   
It needs access to the administrative tables in the SOURCE database.

Syntax:
```
heroku pg:push overlord postgresql-dianthus-12345 -a arcanum-creek-16033
```
2. Make sure the Bootstrap links are in the application.html.erb file

Add just before the </head> tag.
```
<!-- BOOTSTRAP -->
<link href="//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/<version#>/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
<script src="//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/<version#>/js/bootstrap.min.js"> </script>
```
wher <version#> is what you're using, eg, `4.1.1`

also need the JS links just above the </body> tag.

These do not seem to be needed except on Heroku.  Don't know why, yet.
